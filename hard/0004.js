[1,3,19,15,30]

[2,4,8,10,40]

[1,2,3,4,8,10,15,19,30,40]

(8+10)/2

median is 9

we can't treat it as a matrix because the arrays can be different sizes and also the numbers increment at different rates

we can't combine the arrays and sort as that would be o(nlogn)

maybe we can add the arrays and find the total length we're working with

length is 10 in this case

essentially wouldn't we just have to find the numbers at position 5 and 6?? in the middle?

what if the array were 

[1,3,19,15,30]

1,19,30

[2,4]

2,2,4

we need the number at 7/2, which is 4
